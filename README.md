# fluorescence microscopy microfludic molecule analyzer
 For a molecule on frame of a tif video, tracks the molecule via its center of mass, calculates mean squared displacement, allows user to fit to find diffusion, calculates molecular weight based off of inputted bp/intensity calibration, calculates gyration tensor and calculates radius of gyration. Saves all of this info to a cell array
